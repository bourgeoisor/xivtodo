Adding characters should be a smoother experience now. That said, the API is still not 100% consistent and I am still working on stabilization before I move on to new features. Feel free to keep making full use of the <a href='/checklist'>Checklist</a> page in the meantime, since that feature doesn't rely on Lodestone. Again, thank you for your patience!"

        "published": "September 16, 2021",
        "content": "Firstly, thank you all for your support and interest! After the traction this site has gotten from a <a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/powkci/overwhelmed_with_the_amount_of_content_and_not/' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>Reddit thread</a>, the API I use to get information from Lodestone is getting rate-limited by the amount of people trying out XIV ToDo at the same time. Unfortunately, this means that the Lodestone is returning errors and incomplete data-sets. As such, you may be unable to add a character or get a complete and accurate view of your progression until the load stabilizes. I am looking into mitigating this issue in the future, but in the meantime please try refreshing your characters again later. Thank you!"
