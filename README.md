## Development

### Frontend

1. Make sure the following requirements are installed:

   - NodeJS 16+
   - npm

2. Clone the repository:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/bourgeoisor/xivtodo
   cd xivtodo/frontend/
   ```

3. Fetch dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

4. Run one of the following commands:
   ```sh
   npm run serve # serve the frontend locally
   npm run build # built the dist directory
   npm run lint # lint the frontend
   vue ui # open vue's interactive ui
   ```

By default, the frontend will attempt to use a local backend (`localhost:8181`). To develop against the production backend, modify the following environment variable in the `.env` file before serving:

```sh
VUE_APP_BACKEND_API_URI=https://api.xivtodo.com
```

**Note**: With that setup, you will not be able to sign in with Discord due to security policies. It is recommended to run both the frontend and backend locally.

### Backend

1. Make sure the following requirements are installed:

   - Go 1.20+

2. Clone the repository:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/bourgeoisor/xivtodo
   cd xivtodo/backend/
   ```

3. Fetch dependencies:

   ```sh
   go mod
   ```

4. Set the following environment variables:

   ```
   GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=backend-sa.json # Google Cloud service account key
   DISCORD_CLIENT_ID=<discord_client_id>
   DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET=<discord_client_secret>
   DISCORD_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:8080/auth
   ```

5. Run the backend server:

   ```sh
   go run main
   ```

**Note**: As seen by the environment variables, running the backend locally requires both a Discord application client secret as well as a Google Cloud service account with permissions to a Firestore database. Ideally, it would be possible to run the backend with an internal mock database and a mock Discord sign-in to avoid those requirements.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome and appreciated. Simply open up a new issue, or fork the repository to open up a new pull request against the upstream main branch.
