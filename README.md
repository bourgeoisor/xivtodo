## Development

### Frontend

1. Make sure you have the following requirements:
   - Node.js 20+ installed locally
   - npm installed locally
   - Vue's CLI installed locally (`npm install -g @vue/cli`)

2. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/bourgeoisor/xivtodo
   cd xivtodo/frontend/
   ```

3. Fetch dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

4. Run one of the following commands:
   ```sh
   npm run serve # serve the frontend locally
   npm run build # build the dist directory
   npm run lint # lint the frontend
   vue ui # open vue's interactive ui
   ```

By default, the frontend will attempt to use a local backend (`localhost:8181`). To develop against the production backend, modify the following environment variable in the `.env` file before serving:
```sh
VUE_APP_BACKEND_API_URI=https://api.xivtodo.com
```

**Note**: With that setup, you will not be able to sign in with Discord due to security policies. It is recommended to run both the frontend and backend locally.

### Backend

1. Make sure you have the following requirements:
   - Google Cloud project with the Firestore API enabled
   - Service Account with RW permissions to Firestore
   - Discord application with an OAuth2 redirect to `http://localhost:8080/auth`
   - Go 1.22+ installed locally

2. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/bourgeoisor/xivtodo
   cd xivtodo/backend/
   ```

3. Fetch dependencies:
   ```sh
   go mod
   ```

4. Set the following environment variables:
   ```
   GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=backend-sa.json # Google Cloud service account key
   DISCORD_CLIENT_ID=<discord_client_id>
   DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET=<discord_client_secret>
   DISCORD_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:8080/auth
   ```

5. Run the backend server:
   ```sh
   go run main
   ```
